Personal URL shortener

## Make your own

Clicking this button will clone the repo and deploy it to Netlify:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/fgiuliani/facu.link)

You can add a link by running `npm run shorten websitelink path` where `websitelink` is the route you want to shorten, and `path` is the path that'll replace it. If you omit `path`, it'll give you a random string.
